# üçø How to Run the Website on Your System

## Step 1: Download and Extract the Code

Firstly, download the entire website code and extract the ZIP file to a folder on your local system.

## Step 2: Obtain the TMDB Movies API Key and Firebase Configuration

Before starting the website, you will need to obtain the TMDB Movies API key and Firebase configuration. Follow these steps to obtain them and add them to your `.env` file.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Get TMDB API Key 

- Go to https://www.themoviedb.org/ and log in.
- Click on your user profile picture in the navigation bar, and select "Settings".
- In the settings, select "API" and generate an API key.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Firebase Setup 

Note that Firebase is only required for Google authentication. If you are not using Google authentication in your application, you can skip this step.

- Go to the Firebase Console and create a new app.
- After creating the app, build a web app by clicking "Add App" and following the instructions.

- Copy the configuration information provided in the green line, and paste it into the `.env` file:

- Next, to activate Google authentication in Firebase, go to **Build > Authentication** and enable Google authentication.
- To use Google authentication in localhost, add your localhost/127.0.0.1 as an Authorized Domain at **Build > Authentication > Settings > Authorized Domains** and add localhost or 127.0.0.1 to this section.

## Step 3: Run the Website

Open your code editor (such as VS Code) and navigate to the project directory. Then, open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the application. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the website.

Note: Ensure that you have carefully added the TMDB API key and Firebase authentication configuration to your .env file. If the .env file is not working, add all the API keys and configuration manually.
